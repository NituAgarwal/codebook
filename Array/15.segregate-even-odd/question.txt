Segregate Even and Odd numbers
Given an array A[], write a function that segregates even and odd numbers. The functions should put all even numbers first, and then odd numbers.

Example

Input  = {12, 34, 45, 9, 8, 90, 3}
Output = {12, 34, 8, 90, 45, 9, 3} 
In the output, order of numbers can be changed, i.e., in the above example 34 can come before 12 and 3 can come before 9.
