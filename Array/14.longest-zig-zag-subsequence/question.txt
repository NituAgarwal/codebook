The longest Zig-Zag subsequence problem is to find length of the longest subsequence of given sequence such that all elements of this are alternating.
If a sequence {x1, x2, .. xn} is alternating sequence then its element satisfy one of the following relation :

  x1 < x2 > x3 < x4 > x5 < …. xn or
  x2 > x2 < x3 > x4 < x5 > …. xn

  Input: arr[] = {10, 22, 9, 33, 49, 50, 31, 60}
  Output: 6
  The subsequences {10, 22, 9, 33, 31, 60}
