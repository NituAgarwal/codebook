Find zeroes to be flipped so that number of consecutive 1â€™s is maximized
Given a binary array and an integer m, find the position of zeroes flipping which creates maximum number of consecutive 1s in array.
Examples:

Input:   arr[] = {1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1}
         m = 2
Output:  5 7
We are allowed to flip maximum 2 zeroes. If we flip
arr[5] and arr[7], we get 8 consecutive 1's which is
maximum possible under given constraints 

Input:   arr[] = {1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1}
         m = 1
Output:  7
We are allowed to flip maximum 1 zero. If we flip 
arr[7], we get 5 consecutive 1's which is maximum 
possible under given constraints.

Input:   arr[] = {0, 0, 0, 1}
         m = 4
Output:  0 1 2
Since m is more than number of zeroes, we can flip
all zeroes.
