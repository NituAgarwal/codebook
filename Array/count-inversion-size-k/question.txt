Given an array arr[] of size n. 
k elements are given.
Consider k = 3.
Three elements arr[i], arr[j] and arr[k] form an inversion of size 3 if a[i] > a[j] >a[k] and i < j < k. Find total number of inversions of size k.

Example:

Input:  {8, 4, 2, 1}
k=3
Output: 4
The four inversions are (8,4,2), (8,4,1), (4,2,1) and (8,2,1).

Input:  {9, 6, 4, 5, 8}
k=3
Output:  2
The two inversions are {9, 6, 4} and {9, 6, 5}


Approach:
Step1: Question should be clear. In this consider if array can have duplicate values.
If array can have negative numbers

Step2: think clearly
